This is a simple CGI Web server that accept HTTP GET requests and outputs a valid HTML with content as well as appropriate errors. 
This program uses select, pipes, fork, socket, read/write.

First download these files localy, and run make in the terminal.
Then run wserver but typng the following command: './wserver pppppp' where pppppp is a port number other than 80.

If you run a web browser (for example,firefox, chrome, lynx) on the same machine as your web server program, you can connect to your web server by entering a url as 
http://127.0.0.1:ppppp/prog or http://localhost:ppppp/prog where ppppp is replaced by the port number that your server is listening on, and prog is the name of the 
program you want to run (simple, slowcgi, term, large). The address 127.0.0.1 and name localhost identify the machine on which the browser is running.

You can also use the nc program to act as a client to your web server. Run it as "nc localhost ppppp" where ppppp is the port number of your web server. 
Then type in your GET request, and you will see the output in text form.  Remember to use either "-c" or "-C" to send the network newlines. Also remember 
that an HTTP request message is terminated by a blank line, so you will have to hit "enter" twice to send "\r\n\r\n".

The GET requests that this server accepts are:

GET /large?arg1=1 HTTP/1.1
GET /term?arg1=1 HTTP/1.1
GET /simple?arg1=name&arg2=value HTTP/1.1
GET /slowcgi?arg1=name HTTP/1.1

feel free to give as many arguments as you like.
